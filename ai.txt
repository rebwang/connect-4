Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    Yes.

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
    Yes! I wasn't able to beat computer at the first round.

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
    Iterate through each column, find the lowest available cell in each column, and calculate for 2 scenarios:
    1. If yellow disk is in this cell, what will the connect status of yellow disks be?
    2. If red disk is in this cell, what will the connect status of red disks be?
    By calculating this, we are able to determine the next step computer should take is either stack yellow disk, or block red disk from stacking.
    If yellow(computer) is going to win after it drops a disk into that cell, then computer should choose stack instead of block.
    If red(human player) is going to win after it drops a disk into that cell, then computer should choose block instead of stack.
    If no player is going to win in this round, then see if red has more consecutive disks. If yes, then computer should choose block, else choose stack.

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    My friend and I played 5 times. Here is the result: 1 tie, 2 human wins, 2 computer wins.

How would you improve it in the future?
    Right now the strategy is quite general. To improve, we should consider more specific scenarios, for example lure human player to take the step that
    would help my next step, especially when trying to stack disks in diagonal directions.
