Which functions you tested for Part 1
    I tested the constructor of GameController class and Board class. 
    I also test is_in_drop_area(), alternate_player(), reset_dropping() functions in Board class.
    Since mouse listener is not easy to test via pytest, I tested them via playing the game, 
    such as drag mouse within drop area, drag mouse from playground to drop area, 
    drag mouse from drop area to playground, press mouse in the drop area while disk is dropping.

A summary of valid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘good’ result) and expected return values
    Function get_col_by_x(x) in Board class:
    valid inputs will be the x-coordinate within 0 and board width
    expected return values will be the column index within board range

    Function get_lowest_empty_cell(col) in Board class:
    valid inputs will be the column index within board range
    expected return values will be the lowest empty cell in that column or None

A summary of invalid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘bad’ result) and expected return values
    Function get_col_by_x(x) in Board class:
    invalid inputs will be the x-coordinate exceed board width
    expected return values will be the column index out of board range

    Function get_lowest_empty_cell(col) in Board class:
    ivalid inputs will be the colmn indext out of board range
    expected return values will be indext out of range error

Whether you’re confident you’ve verified every possible eventuality
    Not 100% confident but I've tested all the possible eventuality that I can think of

Whether your testing revealed any bugs that you then went back and fixed.
    No. Didn't encounter bug so far.
